## 🎓 About Me

I am currently a **Postdoctoral Research Fellow** in the Department of Statistics at the **University of Michigan**, working with **Prof. Ji Zhu** and **Prof. Gongjun Xu**. I received my **Ph.D. in Statistics** from **Beijing Normal University (BNU)**, where I was fortunate to be advised by **Prof. Lixing Zhu**. I am also thankful to **Ms. Qiushi Tian** for her warm encouragement and insightful advice throughout my doctoral studies. Prior to my doctoral studies, I completed my undergraduate education in Statistics at Beijing Normal University, graduating in 2020.

My research revolves around developing and applying novel statistical methodologies to tackle challenges posed by complex data. I am particularly passionate about:

*   Statistical Inference for complex data structures
*   Model-Structure Detection and specification testing  
*   High-Dimensional Data analysis and change point detection
*   Machine Learning methods with statistical guarantees
